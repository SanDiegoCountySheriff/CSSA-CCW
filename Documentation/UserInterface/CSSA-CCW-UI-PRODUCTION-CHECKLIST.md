  CSSA-CCW Front End MVP Production Checklist
  <br>
</h1>

<h4 align="center">List of all elements need to have / to test before launching the website / HTML page to production.</h4>

---

## How to test?

* ![Medium][medium_svg] means that the item is **highly recommended** and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
* ![High][high_svg] means that the item **can't be omitted** by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

---

## Head

> **Notes:** You can find [a list of everything](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) that could be found in the `<head>` of an HTML document.

### Meta tag

* [ ] **Doctype:** ![High][high_svg] The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

```html
<!doctype html> <!-- HTML5 -->
```

> * 📖 [Determining the character encoding - HTML5 W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#determining-the-character-encoding)

*The next 2 meta tags (Charset and Viewport) need to come first in the head.*

* [ ] **Charset:** ![High][high_svg] The charset (UTF-8) is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Set character encoding for the document -->
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

* [ ] **Viewport:** ![High][high_svg] The viewport is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Viewport for responsive web design -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
```

* [ ] **Title:** ![High][high_svg] A title is used on all pages (SEO: Google calculates the pixel width of the characters used in the title, and it cuts off between 472 and 482 pixels. The average character limit would be around 55-characters).

```html
<!-- Document Title -->
<title>Page Title less than 55 characters</title>
```

> * 📖 [Title - HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)
> * 🛠 [SERP Snippet Generator](https://www.sistrix.com/serp-snippet-generator/)

* [ ] **Description:** ![High][high_svg] A meta description is provided, it is unique and doesn't possess more than 150 characters.

```html
<!-- Meta Description -->
<meta name="description" content="Description of the page less than 150 characters">
```

> * 📖 [Meta Description - HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#Adding_an_author_and_description)

* [ ] **Favicons:** ![Medium][medium_svg] Each favicon has been created and displays correctly. If you have only a `favicon.ico`, put it at the root of your site. Normally you won't need to use any markup. However, it's still good practice to link to it using the example below. Today, **PNG format is recommended** over `.ico` format (dimensions: 32x32px).

```html
<!-- Standard favicon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://example.com/favicon.ico">
<!-- Recommended favicon format -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://example.com/favicon.png">
```

> * 🛠 [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)

> * 📖 [PNG favicons - caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-icon-png)


Minimum required xml markup for the `browserconfig.xml` file is as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<browserconfig>
   <msapplication>
     <tile>
        <square70x70logo src="small.png"/>

     </tile>
   </msapplication>
</browserconfig>
```

> * 📖 [Browser configuration schema reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn320426(v=vs.85).aspx)

* [ ] **Canonical:** ![Medium][medium_svg] Use `rel="canonical"` to avoid duplicate content.

```html
<!-- Helps prevent duplicate content issues -->
<link rel="canonical" href="http://example.com/2017/09/a-new-article-to-read.html">
```

> * 📖 [Use canonical URLs - Search Console Help - Google Support](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en)
> * 📖 [5 common mistakes with rel=canonical - Google Webmaster Blog](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2013/04/5-common-mistakes-with-relcanonical.html)

### HTML tags

* [ ] **Language attribute:** ![High][high_svg] The `lang` attribute of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page.

```html
<html lang="en">
```

* [ ] **CSS Critical:** ![Medium][medium_svg] The CSS critical (or "above the fold") collects all the CSS used to render the visible portion of the page. It is embedded before your principal CSS call and between `<style></style>` in a single line (minified).

> * 🛠 [Critical by Addy Osmani on GitHub](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical) automates this.

* [ ] **CSS order:** ![High][high_svg] All CSS files are loaded before any JavaScript files in the `<head>`. (Except the case where sometimes JS files are loaded asynchronously on top of your page).

## Server

- [ ] **Page weight < 1500 KB (ideally < 500 KB):** ![high_svg] Reduce the size of your page + resources as much as you can.

    *Why:*
    > Ideally you should try to target < 500 KB but the state of web shows that the median of Kilobytes is around 1500 KB (even on mobile). Depending on your target users, network connection, devices, it's important to reduce as much as possible your total Kilobytes to have the best user experience possible.

    *How:*
    > ⁃ All the rules inside the Front-End Performance Checklist will help you to reduce as much as possible your resources and your code.

    * 📖 [Page Weight](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesTotal)

- [ ] **Page load times < 3 seconds:** ![high_svg] Reduce as much as possible your page load times to quickly deliver your content to your users.

    *Why:*
    > Faster your website or app is, less you have probability of bounce increases, in other terms you have less chances to lose your user or future client. Enough researches on the subject prove that point.

    *How:*
    > Use online tools like [Page Speed Insight](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) or [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) to analyze what could be slowing you down and use the Front-End Performance Checklist to improve your load times.

## Performance

### Best practices

* [ ] **Goals to achieve:** ![Medium][medium_svg] Your pages should reach these goals:
  * First Meaningful Paint under 1 second

## Accessibility

> **Notes:** You can watch the playlist [A11ycasts with Rob Dodson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g) 📹

### Best practices

* [ ] **Progressive enhancement:** ![Medium][medium_svg] Major functionality like main navigation and search should work without JavaScript enabled.

> * 📖 [Enable / Disable JavaScript in Chrome Developer Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBmvq2cE0D8)

* [ ] **Color contrast:** ![Medium][medium_svg] Color contrast should at least pass WCAG AA (AAA for mobile).

> * 🛠 [Contrast ratio](https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)

#### Headings

* [ ] **H1:** ![High][high_svg] All pages have an H1 which is not the title of the website.
* [ ] **Headings:** ![High][high_svg] Headings should be used properly and in the right order (H1 to H6).

### Semantics

* [ ] **Specific HTML5 input types are used:** ![Medium][medium_svg] This is especially important for mobile devices that show customized keypads and widgets for different types.

> * 📖 [Mobile Input Types](http://mobileinputtypes.com/)

### Form

* [ ] **Label:** ![High][high_svg] A label is associated with each input form element. In case a label can't be displayed, use `aria-label` instead.

> * 📖 [Using the aria-label attribute - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)

### Accessibility testing

* [ ] **Accessibility standards testing:** ![High][high_svg] Use the WAVE tool to test if your page respects the accessibility standards.

> * 🛠 [Wave testing](http://wave.webaim.org/)

* [ ] **Keyboard navigation:** ![High][high_svg] Test your website using only your keyboard in a previsible order. All interactive elements are reachable and usable.
* [ ] **Screen-reader:** ![Medium][medium_svg] All pages were tested in a screen-reader (VoiceOver, ChromeVox, NVDA or Lynx).
* [ ] **Focus style:** ![High][high_svg] If the focus is disabled, it is replaced by visible state in CSS.
