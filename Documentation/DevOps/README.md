# CCW DevOps Documentation

## Overview

All of the Infrastructure code and DevOps pipelines are contained within the `Deployment` folder.

## Infrastructure

The `Deployment\IaC\Infrastructure` folder contains the sandbox ARM template, `sandboxTemplate.json`.  This template has been used to create resources in the Dev resource groups.  The sandbox template contains all the resources needed by the CCW application with the exception of the deployment scripts, which are contained in the Marketplace template.

A sample ARM Template Parameters file, `sandboxTemplate.parameters.json` is included and contains the parameter values needed for deployment to the Dev environment.
